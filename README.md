# Javascript Type Coercion playground
This is a JS Type Coercion playground to show off the weired behaviour of javascript regarding types. 
I probably went too far and compiled the source of code of a fully functional js type coercion compiler with a js type coercion compiler.

## Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Instructions
To run the example use the following command:

```node index.js```

You will find the output under the /dist folder.
